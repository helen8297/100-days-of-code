# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 28th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent over an hour preparing for the School of Code bootcamp interview day on Saturday. Sent off my task for the bootcamp interview. Wrote notes for possible interview questions. Committed to 100 days of code.

**Thoughts:** Excited! Looking forward to the bootcamp interview day despite some nerves. Excited about starting 100 days of code. Want to finish the codecademy CSS, add to the website i've started (just to practice with) and then start watch and code's javascript lessons.

**Link to work:** ...nothing yet!

### Day 1: December 1st, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I did the first lesson of Codecademy's CSS course a while ago but i didn't write up notes. I'd forgotten most of it so today I went through it all again and wrote up my notes on dev.to. Looking forward to carrying on with the rest of it tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** Kind of had a day of coding but not yesterday...it was interview day for the school of code in Bham. This week will involve email/phone checking to find out if i'm through or not. Fingers crossed.
