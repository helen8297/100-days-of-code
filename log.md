# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 28th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent over an hour preparing for the School of Code bootcamp interview day on Saturday. Sent off my task for the bootcamp interview. Wrote notes for possible interview questions. Committed to 100 days of code.

**Thoughts:** Excited! Looking forward to the bootcamp interview day despite some nerves. Excited about starting 100 days of code. Want to finish the codecademy CSS, add to the website i've started (just to practice with) and then start watch and code's javascript lessons.
