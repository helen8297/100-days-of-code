# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 28th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent over an hour preparing for the School of Code bootcamp interview day on Saturday. Sent off my task for the bootcamp interview. Wrote notes for possible interview questions. Committed to 100 days of code.

**Thoughts:** Excited! Looking forward to the bootcamp interview day despite some nerves. Excited about starting 100 days of code. Want to finish the codecademy CSS, add to the website i've started (just to practice with) and then start watch and code's javascript lessons.

### Day 2: December 1st, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I did the first lesson of Codecademy's CSS course a while ago but i didn't write up notes. I'd forgotten most of it so today I went through it all again and wrote up my notes on dev.to. Looking forward to carrying on with the rest of it tomorrow. 

**Thoughts**: Kind of had a day of coding but not yesterday...it was interview day for the school of code in Bham. This week will involve email/phone checking to find out if i'm through or not. Fingers crossed.

### Day 3: December 2nd, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Did the second lesson in Codecademy's CSS course - Visual Rules. Wrote it up on Dev.to

**Thoughts**: Not a lot, got through it quite quickly. Would like to do the pro projects but its expensive to join!

### Day 4: December 3rd, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started the third lesson of Codecademy's CSS course - The box method. 

**Thoughts**: Feeling a bit tired. Did an hour. Would like to do pro (again) just to get more used to using what i'm learning...but I also want to get through this so I can start the javascript course. Might finish this, do the javascript course and then try the pro projects perhaps.

### Day 5: December 9th, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the box model lesson on codecademy's CSS course and wrote about it on a dev article so i can't remember it!

**Thoughts:** I let this slip for the past 6 days. I've been decorating, doing house jobs and making a long video for a christmas present so i'll have to try harder to fit it in.

### Day 6: December 10th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Paused the codecademy lesson to update my Christmas list. Did it on my github website so had a little practice and updated the css. Had a bug and corrected it - hooray! Also imported a google font i think although it seemed a little too easy.

**Thoughts:**  I want to learn how to do more with my website. I still feel like i'm missing a lot e.g. how to put elements next to each other etc - a lot of basic stuff.

**Today's Progress**: Did the changing the box model lesson from codecademy and wrote it up.

### Day 8: December 18th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed half the markdown tutorial ready for January and wrote it up on dev.to so i can refer back to it later.

**Thoughts:**  Feel a bit bad about not coding every single day, but the last week has been so busy and tiring!

### Day 9: December 29th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Signed up to stackoverflow, improved my linkedin profile and did lots of twitter browsing. Also completed the markdown tutorial and wrote it up to refer back to later on. 

**Thoughts:**  Happy to get back to it. Need to continue now so i'm ready for the start of bootcamp in Jan. Would like to start reading my books more often too.

### Day 10: December 30th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed lesson 5 of codecademy's CSS series - display and positioning. 

**Thoughts:**  Glad to finally have gotten onto something that explains positioning elements on a webpage - until now i've had no clue about how it works.
